# Genomic Medicine Demystified: *What does my genetic test result mean?*

With the adoption of genetic variant analysis into clinical practice and even in popular science (genealogy and health prediction), a real question has arisen about how to understand the results of genetic tests. This is true for clinicians who are trying to use them to customize diagnosis & treatment regimens, biologists who are trying to understand the molecular basis of disease, as well as for the everyday-Joe-or-Jane who want to understand what their 23&Me stuff means.

This project will help the participants learn a pipeline to understand the ramifications of a clinical genetic variant test result - on a possible disease/disorder diagnosis as well as at the molecular level.  What does having this variant mean? What normal biology is impacted? What did this variant do to the normal biology?  How does that relate back to unusual physical changes or symptoms?  What can be done now? 

The first portion of this project will provide hands-on experience with real patient cases to learn about the results of the genetic tests and how it impacts him/her/them. [drawing from existing case studies: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/morris/GWUMed/2020/]  

Depending upon the make-up of the team (more programmatically savvy or more interested in scientific communication), the second portion of this project will have the group clearly define how we could make an end-product (deliverable) to inform a user on what a specific variant means. The last part of the
project would be to create the deliverable, which could take the form of an analytic pipeline (NCBI EUtils + code) with an HTML webpage or a Mobile App for a coding-savvy team or for those with scientific communication interests - be some sort of guide, infographic, poster or brochure for clinicians or the lay population to show them how to figure out what their own test results mean.
